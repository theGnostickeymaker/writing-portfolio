# Writing Portfolio

This repository contains short samples of my writing for blogs, newsletters, and editorial platforms.

I focus on:

- Current affairs and public policy
- Political and social analysis
- Clear explainers for non-specialist readers

All pieces are written in British English and can be adapted for different tones, audiences, and publication styles.
