# What Online Petitions Can And Cannot Do In UK Democracy

In March 2019, more than six million people signed a petition to revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit. It became the most signed petition in UK parliamentary history. Parliament debated it in Westminster Hall for around ninety minutes. Nothing changed.

That gap between mass participation and political outcome is the story of online petitions in the United Kingdom. Social media feeds fill up with links urging people to "sign and share". Platforms promise that, if a petition reaches a certain threshold, Parliament will have to "listen".

Petitions can be useful. They can also be deeply misleading about how power actually works. This explainer sets out, in plain terms, what online petitions do well, where they fall short, and how they fit into the wider machinery of UK democracy.

## How official petitions work in the UK

The UK Parliament runs an official petitions system alongside several large private platforms. Although each site looks slightly different, the basic model is similar:

- A member of the public drafts a proposal or demand.
- The petition is checked against basic rules, for example no hate speech or duplicate wording.
- If approved, it is published and people can sign it online.
- At certain thresholds, different responses are triggered. On the official parliamentary site, 10,000 signatures guarantees a written government response; 100,000 triggers consideration for a Westminster Hall debate.

On paper this provides a direct route from citizen to legislature. It offers a channel that feels accessible, free, and quick.

## The real strengths of petitions

Petitions are not useless. They have three genuine strengths.

**1. Signalling that an issue exists**

A large number of signatures can send a clear message that a subject has broken out of a small activist circle and reached a wider public. In 2016, a petition calling for the Meningitis B vaccine to be offered to all children, not just newborns, gathered more than 823,000 signatures. The scale of public feeling helped keep the issue on the political agenda and contributed to later expansions of the vaccination programme. For backbench MPs or select committees, numbers like these can be a prompt to investigate, request briefings, or ask awkward questions.

**2. Helping people find one another**

When people sign and share a petition, they also discover others who care about the same issue. Campaign groups, mailing lists, and local meetings often grow out of petition traffic. In that sense a petition can be the doorway into more serious organising.

**3. Creating a public record**

Even when nothing immediate happens, petitions create a visible trail of public concern. Future journalists, researchers, or campaigners can point back to them as evidence that warnings were raised and ignored.

These are real advantages, and it is important not to dismiss them.

## The built-in limits no one explains

However, petitions also have hard limits that are rarely made clear to the public.

**1. Petitions do not create legal obligations**

In most cases, petitions do not force the government to change a law or reverse a policy. The Article 50 revocation petition is the clearest example: six million signatures produced a Westminster Hall debate and a government response reaffirming that Brexit would proceed. At best, petitions may lead to a debate, a statement, or a written response. Executive power remains where it was before.

**2. Petitions can duplicate and dilute**

Because anyone can create a petition, it is common to see multiple petitions about the same issue, often with slightly different wording. In the months after the 2016 EU referendum, several competing petitions appeared calling for a second vote, each with different framing and none consolidating the full weight of public demand behind a single ask. Supporters are split between them, numbers look smaller than they are, and no single petition crosses the thresholds that trigger official attention.

**3. Petitions are easy to ignore**

A government under pressure can acknowledge a petition in polite terms and then proceed exactly as planned. In 2017, a petition opposing a full state visit for Donald Trump passed 1.8 million signatures and was debated in Parliament, but the visit went ahead in 2019. A short debate in a quiet committee room may technically "fulfil" the promise attached to the petition platform, while changing nothing on the ground.

**4. Petitions can absorb anger that might otherwise organise**

Most importantly, petitions can function as a pressure valve. Signing and sharing feels like action. It scratches the moral itch. After that, many people move on, leaving the underlying issue untouched.

## How to use petitions more effectively

None of this means that people should stop creating or signing petitions. It does mean they should treat petitions as tools, not as magic spells.

More effective use looks like this:

- **One strong petition per issue, not five weak ones.** Campaigners should coordinate and agree wording where possible, so that signatures concentrate instead of fragmenting.
- **Link petitions to real-world follow-up.** A petition should be one element in a wider strategy that might include constituency surgeries, local meetings, media work, and legal challenges.
- **Use petitions to collect contact details, not just signatures.** The real power lies in the ability to reach supporters again when there is a concrete step to take.
- **Track what happens after thresholds are reached.** Publishing simple timelines of “we reached X signatures on this date, the response arrived on that date” helps people understand how the system behaves.

## A realistic way to think about petitions

Petitions are best understood as an invitation rather than a decision. They invite attention, they invite conversation, and they invite people into a loose community of concern. They do not, on their own, move the machinery of government.

For citizens and campaigners, the honest question is not “Should we have a petition?” but “What will we do with the attention if it works?”

Treating petitions as one tool among many, instead of as a substitute for organisation, is the first step towards a more realistic and effective kind of democratic pressure.
