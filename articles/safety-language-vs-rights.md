# Why the Language of "Safety" Is Replacing the Language of Rights

In 2023, the United Kingdom passed the Online Safety Act. The name is worth pausing on. An earlier generation of lawmakers might have called it the Digital Rights and Responsibilities Act, or the Internet Regulation Bill. Instead, the legislation was built around a single, almost unchallengeable word: safety.

This is not just a branding choice. Across British public life, the language of safety is steadily replacing the language of rights. The shift matters more than it might seem, because it changes what questions the public is invited to ask, and which ones quietly disappear.

## From rights to risk

For much of the twentieth century, political debate in the UK was shaped by the language of rights. The right to free expression. The right to protest. The right to privacy. The right to housing. Rights language places the citizen at the centre: the state has obligations, and when it fails to meet them, individuals can demand accountability.

Over the past two decades, a different vocabulary has moved in. Governments now talk about keeping people safe online, keeping communities safe from extremism, and keeping children safe from harm. The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, which introduced sweeping restrictions on protest, was presented not as a limitation on the right to assemble but as a necessary response to "serious disruption" that threatened public safety. During the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions on movement, association, and worship were framed almost entirely through the logic of safety rather than as temporary suspensions of established rights.

The word "risk" is central to this shift. Where rights language asks "what are people entitled to?", risk language asks "what might go wrong?". That reframing sounds reasonable. But it tilts every conversation towards caution, control, and the authority of those who claim to manage danger on our behalf.

## Why "safety" is politically attractive

Safety is powerful because it is almost impossible to oppose. No politician wants to be seen arguing against keeping children safe or making streets safer. The language comes pre-loaded with moral authority.

This gives it three distinct advantages for governments.

**It is vague enough to cover almost anything.** The Online Safety Act covers terrorist content, child sexual abuse material, fraud, self-harm content, and what it calls "legal but harmful" material. These are wildly different problems requiring different responses, but the umbrella of "safety" lets them sit together without the government having to justify each trade-off individually.

**It positions the state as protector rather than restrictor.** When the Metropolitan Police used facial recognition technology at the Notting Hill Carnival and on high streets in London, the justification was public safety. That framing casts the state as a guardian. Rights language would force a different conversation: about surveillance, about disproportionate targeting of Black communities, and about the right to move through public space without being scanned.

**It sidesteps the adversarial nature of rights.** Rights exist against someone, usually the state. They imply that power must be checked. Safety implies no such tension. It suggests that the state and the citizen want the same thing, which may be true in some cases but is a dangerous assumption to generalise.

## What gets lost when rights language fades

The most important difference between rights and safety is enforceability. A right is specific: it defines what you are entitled to and creates a legal obligation on the state to provide or protect it. Safety is discretionary: it depends on how the government chooses to define and measure it, and it can be withdrawn or redefined without the same legal friction.

Consider housing. The phrase "safe housing" implies a minimum standard: no mould, no fire risk, no collapsing ceilings. The phrase "right to housing" implies something larger: that people are entitled to a home, and that the state has a duty to ensure one is available. After the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, which killed seventy-two people, it became clear that safety language without an enforceable rights framework is hollow. The building had been covered in flammable cladding despite warnings. Safety regulations existed on paper but were not enforced, because there was no robust mechanism for residents to assert their rights against landlords and regulators who treated compliance as optional.

When rights language fades, three things tend to follow. People lose a vocabulary for making demands of the state. Policy debates become conversations about management rather than justice. And the question of who bears the cost of government decisions becomes harder to raise, because safety language rarely names a responsible party.

## Safety versus accountability

Safety language often avoids scrutiny precisely because it sounds protective. Measures introduced "for your safety" carry an implicit instruction not to question them too closely.

The Prevent programme, the government's counter-radicalisation strategy, operates under the banner of keeping people safe from extremism. In practice, it has been criticised for disproportionately surveilling Muslim communities, chilling free speech in universities, and requiring teachers and doctors to act as informal intelligence gatherers. A rights-based framing would demand that these intrusions be weighed against the right to privacy, the right to free expression, and the right to equal treatment. A safety-based framing tends to shortcut that analysis: if the goal is preventing harm, the burden shifts to critics to prove that the measures are unnecessary.

The same pattern appears in policing. Section 60 stop-and-search powers, which allow officers to search anyone in a defined area without individual suspicion, are justified as a safety measure against knife crime. Home Office data has consistently shown that Black people are searched at vastly disproportionate rates under these powers. Safety language makes that disparity harder to challenge, because the conversation is anchored around "saving lives" rather than around the civil liberties of those being stopped.

## A more honest framing

None of this is an argument against safety as a concept. Governments have a legitimate role in protecting people from harm. The argument is against safety as a replacement for rights, and against the quiet substitution of one framework for the other without public acknowledgement of what is being traded away.

A more honest public language would do three things. First, it would name the rights affected whenever a safety measure is proposed. If new legislation restricts what people can say, see, or do, that restriction should be stated plainly, not buried under reassuring language about protection. Second, it would require governments to explain the trade-off: not just "this will make you safer" but "this will make you safer at this specific cost to these specific freedoms". Third, it would preserve the adversarial element that rights language provides, the reminder that the state is powerful and that its power must be justified, not simply trusted.

The language of rights is uncomfortable. It assumes conflict between citizen and state. It demands specifics. It creates obligations that are expensive and inconvenient to meet. That is exactly why it matters, and exactly why its quiet replacement should concern anyone who takes democratic accountability seriously.
